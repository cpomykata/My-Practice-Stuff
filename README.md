# My-Practice-Stuff
# Hey, my name is Corbin and I am currently a Flow Cytometry Scientist. But that isn't what I want to do with my life.
# I am currently trying to learn programming so that one day I can get a job I am happy to do.
# This place will be a record of my improvements and capabilities.
# Thank you for stopping by!
